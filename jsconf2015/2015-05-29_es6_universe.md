# If you wish to learn ES6/2015 from scratch, you must first invent the universe

Ashley Williams, @ag_dubs, "someone who makes mistakes"

## Cows in Space
* Abstraction - Dijkstra quote on powers of abstraction (TK find it)
* Behavior of programmers === abstracting
* The abstraction principle - Benjamin C. Pierce quote from TAPL (TK find it)
* Level of human thought
  * Leave out things that matter in practice
  * But are immaterial to the problem being solved

## Teaching experiences
* NYC based on, bootcamp for out of work people
* To go from no experience to viable junior developer
* She taught there for a year
* Learned from those beginners
* Iteration is hard
  * Abelson, Sussman
  * "Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute"
  * People struggle with instructions
  * Picking a language that expresses the underlying concepts
    * State
    * Condition
    * Increment
    * (Me: Sugar impedes understandability, de-sugaring as its place for concept mapping)
* Feynmane quote - precision isn't real problem, clarity is; precision only helps when the thing is super abstracted
* Picasso - there is no abstract art, quote (TK find)
  * Must start with a real thing
  * Can then remove everything
* Drawing an owl - leaping from first step to finished

## Back to cows in space
* Humans are great pattern matchers
* Books actually aren't so great with that ability
* Need to be careful about the abstractions we make
* Abstractions become our ideologies
* Risk is that abstractions shear from underlying concepts

## Javascript
* Not a lot abstractions in the language itself
* Why it is so accessible for beginners
* That is about to change
* ES6 spec - syntax is relaxed to be easy to use
* What is immaterial to problem to solve - risk?
* What problem is JS trying to solve?
* Relatively new value - learn on for both client and server

## ES6 classes
* Syntactic sugar can be obfuscating some important 
* ES6 spec - objects are not fundamentally class based, though has class support
* Box quote - about all models being wrong, how wrong until they are not useful
* ES6 spec - inheritance carries everything
* Blog post - prototypes aren't classes
  * Classes are blueprints
  * JS classes are model homes

## Sharpening critique of ES6 classes
* Not hating on TC39
* Looking at simula for h
* Thinking for programmers
  * Writing for understanding how sloppy thinking is
  * Speaker: Teaching for understanding how sloppy our understanding is
* Abelson, Sussman - SICP, teach concepts not syntax
* van Roy - CTM as follow up
  * Problem-solution pairs; paradigms
  * Kernel teaching methid
  * Start with a simple language and extend incrementally
  * Students build their own abstractions as they go
  * Creative extension principle
* (Me: node embodies this)
* Ron Jeffires: only implement when you need, not when you foresee

## Conclusion
* Need to take on an educational perspective
* We are all beginners when we are reasoning about code
* Having abstractions match concepts make that easier
* Cool opportunity in upcoming specs
* Heidegger - what is called thinking
  * Most thought provoking thing...is that we are not thinking
* Are we programming yet?
  * Racket
  * Pyret
* Happening all in academia
  * No good reason we can't be doing that everywhere
* Kuhn - on ignorance of accepted models, why paradigms are institutionalized
* Sagan - reality preferable to reassuring delusion
* Think about our ontology, reconsider, stay a beginner
