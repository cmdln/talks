# JSConf US 2015

Three days on Amelia Island, Florida, packed with talks about JavaScript and web technologies. Also some amazing social events and recreation as part of the conference program.

The break day on Thursday and the social gatherings in the evening felt a bit indulgent at first. By the end of the conference, though, I realized something. I felt way more energized on the two days of talks. I was enthused to be there and felt much more positive about every talk. I don't know that every conference needs to dedicate so much time. All conference organizers should think about building in even some modest time to relax as part of the program. I think it lets the brain process new ideas and knowledge, making the conference more enjoyable and valuable.
