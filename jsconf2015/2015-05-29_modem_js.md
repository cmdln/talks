* First part, good explainer on how, why modems work
  * Went back to the invention of optical telegraphy
  * Then electrical telegraphy
  * Baudot - 5 bit encoding, chorded keyboard, namesake of "baud" or bps
  * Bell - harmonic, or audible, telegraphy
* Went on to discuss audible multiplexing, based on Bell's work
* Second half, shifted to actual code and demo
  * Oscillator node - shift frequency over time
  * ScriptProcessorNode - jit audo processing of data, audio
  * Encoding demo both played sound and had a nice, visual representation of that audio
* Extraction is the hard part
  * Chunk wave into bins
  * How to get from wave to frequency intensity - Goertzel algorithm
    * Input frequency and wave, get back intensity
    * Tried basedband filter with high Q value, wasn't fine grained enough`
  * Goertzel still not perfect, in some bins, not obvious 1 or 0
  * Found hamming window - address noise, leakage; Fourier transform
* Noisy signals - kind of hand waved, here
* More speed
  * Iniital dmeo was 300 baud
  * Could multiplex
  * Overlay different frequency bands to encode more than one bit per bin
* What's next
  * WiFi, Bluetooth, uses phase instead of frequency modulation but otherwise, same techniques
  * Air gapped communications
  * Dynamic JS injection
  * WebRTC modem
  * Unicode/emoji?
  * github/samccone/noise
