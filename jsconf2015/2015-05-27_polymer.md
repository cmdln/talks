  * HTML Imports
  * Templates
  * Shadow DOM
  * Custom Elements
* Templates
  * Parsed but ignored
  * Not put into the DOM by the browser

* HTML imports

  * Made some point, not clear, about styling surprises with imports
* Shadow DOM
  * Way to create a fragment, rooted on arbitrary node
  * Is it on the DOM?
    * His example suggests it is
    * Though there may have been code to add to DOM, make visible
  * Styles do not bleed out onto the rest of the page

  * From Google
  * Syntactic sugar on top of custom elements
  * Data binding
  * Loops
  * Interaction
* Problems still needing answers
  * What should be a component?
  * Limited shadow DOM support
  * Testing
  * Including a js lib (momentjs)
  * Logging - sharing a function for that across components
