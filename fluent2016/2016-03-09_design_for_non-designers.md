# Design for Non-Designers

* @limedaring for links
* Reducing clutter
  * People unconsciously noticed when things don't line up by pixel
  * The grid, for example bootstrap
* Color
  * COLOURlovers - pre-made palettes
  * Help ensure color combinations work well together
* Fonts
  * Keep number of fonts, low
  * More fonts means more clutter
  * Cleaner, more professional fonts yield less clutter
  * Use bolding, italic and transforms if need some judicious differences
  * Google Fonts
  * Beautiful Web Type showcases the best of Google Fonts
  * Typewolf is another good resource
* White space
  * More white space an cut down on perception of clutter
  * Good studies available on impact of white space
* User experience principles
  * What's the most important action in your design? Make that easiest to find
  * Structure text to make it easier to scan, read, for instance bullets, bolding and vertical white space
  * Crafting of headlines can have a high impact, again lots of studies
* Training your design eye
  * Surround yourself with good design
  * Lots of sites that curate good designs as examples
  * Think of design like using Google, StackOverflow for coding
  * Ideas, inspirations, techniques can be copied to make something new and your own
* Sketching -- keep it loose, just to get the idea down
* Mocking -- doesn't have to be pixel perfect, also about organizing, layout, flow
* Process often like coding, struggle until finally snaps into place
* Practice, practice, practice
* Forthcoming book: Hello Wen Design
