# HTTP 1.1 vs. HTTP/2

* Bandwidth not so much the issue as latency
  * HTTP more sensitive to latency
  * Historical reasons - bandwidth limited, pages small
* Two load graphs, one from 96 relatively simple
  * Same vintage browser with today's page shows deep waterfall
  * HTTP 1.0 only allowed/recommended two connections
  * Modern pages have increased in complexity drastically
* HTTP 1.1 addressed some issues
  * Connection re-use
  * At least eliminated overhead of constantly tearing down, re-opening connections
  * Around same time, browsers started ignoring RFC, using more than 2 connections
  * Also added pipelining, client requesting multiple things from each connection
  * Problem with pipelining is that it was complex to implement correctly, didn't really catch on
* Performance optimizations
  * Spriting - single image composing multiples, using scripting, styling to crop
  * Inlining - packing images into css stylesheets
  * Concatenating - combining stylesheets, script sources into single larger files
  * Sharding - to get around connection limitations
  * All come at cost, biggest being complexity both in development and ops
  * Some non-obvious costs like connection overhead when trying to use more and more connections
* HTTP/2 brings multiplexing to address shortcomings of previous attemps
  * Can deeply parallelize resource fetching, over single connection
  * Simplistically, resources chunked into pieces and interleaves
  * Roughly delivers simultaneity
* Other features
  * HTTP/2 is binary rather than text like 1.x and prefers but doesn't require encryption
  * Like web sockets, can use upgrade header
    * Or during TLS ALPN negotation
  * Multiplexing realized as streams
    * Client can prioritize streams
    * Client can also cancel stream at little to no cost
  * Headers are compressed
  * Server can push content to clients
* Footprint
  * more than 70% of installed browsers support it
  * Biggest servers all support it
  * 24% of Firefox traffic is HTTP/2
* The experiment - real world gains going from 1.1 to 2
  * Use exiting site - Amazon
  * Hosting locally in lab environment
  * Emulate different network characteristics, like delay
  * 50-70% reduction in load times
  * Could do more, sites optimized for 1.1
  * Also labe set up not entirely realistic, in real world may be different
  * Worst case, 2 shouldn't be any slower than 1.1
* LoadImpact releasing a tool soon to reproduce same approach for any arbitrary site
