# UX Insights from a Drunk Guy

* uxd.to/drunk
* UX people like to quote words of wisdom
  * DaVinci, "simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"
  * "Hold my Beer"
  * Viral video about drunken UX
  * Basically if UX works well while someone is drunk, UX is well done
  * Someone actually offered this as a service, to drunken test sites
  * theuserisdrunk.com
  * Speaker got this fellow to do drunk user test of their site
* Highlights from that test
  * Like usertesting.com video
  * Smashed together with drunk history
* Feedback was at first harsh
  * But really did reveal gaps in terms of user value, business value
  * Iterated design to better share those values
* Problem is feedback is rarely so honest
  * Does the user actually need to be drunk? No
* What are different types of tests?
  * In-person moderated testing
  * Remote, unmoderated testing
  * Latter is the kind of test done by the drunk tester
* How to use these kinds of test to get honest feedback?
  * Segmentation
    * Know your demographic
    * Make sure that screening doesn't introduce bias
  * Testing
    * Run a pilot test, a test for your test
    * Run a full test with 3-5 users
    * Don't inadvertently lead user
  * Results gathering, distribution
    * Pair the data
    * Use tangential and unsolicited feedback
    * Rainbow spreadsheet
    * Helps bubble up themes
* Tools - see slides
* How to set up for success
  * Don't design in a vacuum
  * Expose to actual users as soon as possible
  * Iterate on real user feedback
  * Good design is invisible
  * Best interfaces are designed so well people don't even notice them, too busy using them
  * Counter example, welcome mat
  * Optimize for speed - 3 seconds on average until user will lead
