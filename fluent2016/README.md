# Fluent 2016

A week long O'Reilly conference in San Francisco on all things JavaScript. One day of training, one day of tutorials and two days of talks. I was able to get my employer to cover the tutorial day and the two days of talks.

I posted to my [life stream about this conference](https://thecommandline.net/tag/fluent-2016). Those posts include random thoughts and impressions about the conference and talks.
